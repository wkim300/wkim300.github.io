  Hi, my name is Woojae Kim, an engineer and a machine learning enthusiast. I have over 6 years of experience as an engineering consultant, based in New York [(Arup)](https://www.arup.com/) and in Seoul.


  Throughout my professional & academic life, my focus has been computational modeling of real-world problems.
  Oddly though, my interest and coursework in optimization methods have naturally led me to pursue further study in computer science. I have recently earned a M.S. in CS from Georgia Tech with [concentration in Machine Learning (ML)](https://omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-machine-learning).
  Throughout the years, I have gained experience in <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>MySQL</mark> and <mark>R</mark>.
  In terms of ML packages, I have extensively used: <mark>Numpy</mark>, <mark>Pandas</mark>, <mark>Scikit-Learn</mark>, <mark>Pytorch</mark>, <mark>Tensorflow</mark>, <mark>Keras</mark> and <mark>BURLAP(Java)</mark>


  I have also tried to compelment my academic knowledge with more practical aspects of machine learning by completing various MOOCS:
    - [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/MTYV99C7PET6) by Stanford University (Prof. Andrew Ng)
    - [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/RJE49R7Q6X3L) by Coursera (Prof. Andrew Ng)
    - [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/3SYYZBBRXHDT) by Coursera
    - [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/3TRZJKQKP78J) by Coursera
    - [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ZYGEA5GEQPNN) by Coursera
    - [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/DXGTET8PR3VY) by Coursera
    - [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/GU2YHQECL475) by Coursera

#  Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.

#  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else markdown supports such as
#    - Lists
#    - Tables
#    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
#    - Images

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
