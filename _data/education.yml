    At UIUC, performed research under professor [Martin Ostoja-Starzewski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TTnw020AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

    Research Topic: Heat transfer in nonlinear materials. Used hyperbolic heat conduction equation (Maxwell-Cattaneo) to model heat conduction in various types of tissues.
    The goal of the project was to have better control of electrosurgical process by developing an active control-feedback system for assisted robotic electrosurgery.
    Designed and conducted experiments to validate superposition of thermal waves in biological tissues (pork meat) and compared the experimental results with analytical models.

    Coursework:
      - Intro to Optimization (ECE 490)
      - Mathematical Methods II (TAM 542)
      - Numerical Fluid and Thermodynamics (ME 412)
      - Intro to Finite Element Methods (ME 471)
      - Viscous Flow (TAM 532)
      - Advanced Continuum Mechanics (TAM 545)
      - Solid Mechanics (TAM 551)
      - Intermediate Solid Mechanics (TAM 451)
