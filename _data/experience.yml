    As part of **military service (병역특례)**, I am working as a research scientist to **develop & deploy Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS)**.

    BEMS is a **software for monitoring, analyzing and controlling energy-consuming equipments** in buildings, such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting and power systems.
    Due to its **multidisciplinary** nature, BEMS engineering requires understanding and knowledge in various areas, including **software engineering, electrical engineering, computer network and mechanical engineering**.
    I have collaborated with **Samsung Electronics** and **Samsung SDS** to test & deploy their [BEMS software](https://www.samsung.com/sec/business/b-iot-solutions/b-iot-solution/) in various [buildings](https://www.samsung.com/sec/business/insights/case-study/reference-sungsin/) in South Korea, as part of government-funded research project.

    As an **research assistant**, performed research in **computational mechanics** under professor [Martin Ostoja-Starzewski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TTnw020AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

    **Research Topic:** Modeling of **heat-transfer in nonlinear materials**. Used hyperbolic heat conduction equation (Maxwell-Cattaneo) to model heat conduction in various types of tissues.
    The goal of the project was to have better control of electrosurgical process by developing an active control-feedback system for assisted robotic electrosurgery.
    Designed and conducted experiments to validate superposition of thermal waves in biological tissues (pork meat) and compared the experimental results with analytical models.

    As a **teaching assistant**, taught & supervised lab sessions for [ME330:Engineering Materials](https://mechanical.illinois.edu/courses/profile/ME330).
