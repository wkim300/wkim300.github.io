    This work (see write-up [here](https://github.com/wkim300/dqn_lunarlander/blob/master/report/drl_lunarlander_wk.pdf)) presents a Deep Q-network (DQN) to solve Open AI Gym’s Lunar Lander environment.
    The trained DQN successfully controls the space fleet in a continuous state-space, enabling safe landings.
    The DQN utilizes three fully connected layers with rectifier nonlinearities to approximate the optimal action-value function.
    Experience replay and bootstrapping method through network duplication were utilized to improve the network’s performance.
    Extensive grid search was performed to fine-tune the network’s hyperparameters and study their effects on the agent’s performance

    I have teamed up with my former classmates at UIUC to design and prototype an **air-purifying robot, Yuikhan** (유익한 로봇).
    Yuikhan is a smarter version of robotic vacuum-for air quality control.
    It autonomously creates map of the living space using **LiDAR** and **SLAM** technology.
    **After recogizing your space, it then purifies the space based on indoor air quality map that it has generated**.
    We have built the robot from scratch using a 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components.
    We then integrated the hardware to and the cleaning algorithm through **Robotic Operating System (ROS)**.
    We have a working protype of the device which syncs with a mobile application for direct control.
    See our [landing page](https://yuikhan.life) for more information.
