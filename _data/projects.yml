    I have teamed up with my former classmates at UIUC to design and prototype an **air-purifying robot, Yuikhan** (유익한 로봇).
    Yuikhan is a smarter version of robotic vacuum-for air quality control.
    It autonomously creates map of the living space using **LiDAR** and **SLAM** technology.
    **After recogizing your space, it then purifies the space based on indoor air quality map that it has generated**.
    We have built the robot from scratch using a 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components.
    We then integrated the hardware to and the cleaning algorithm through **Robotic Operating System (ROS)**.
    We have a working protype of the device which syncs with a mobile application for direct control.
    See our [landing page](https://yuikhan.life) for more information.
